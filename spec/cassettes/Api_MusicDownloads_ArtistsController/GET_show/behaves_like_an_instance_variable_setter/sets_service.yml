        The band currently resides in Cambridge.\n\nUnger-Hamilton studied English
        Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Newman
        showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing
        dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with
        Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband. \n\nFirst as Daljit Dhaliwal and
        then as Films, they spent the next two years playing around town. Their eponymous
        first 4-track demo \u2206, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London
        and included early versions of \"Breezeblocks\", \"Hand-Made\", \"Matilda\"
        and \"Tessellate\".\n\nTheir first 2012 release for Infectious was the triangle
        shaped 7\" \"Matilda\" / \"Fitzpleasure\", followed by \"Breezeblocks\" as
        an advance of their first album An Awesome Wave, released on 25 May 2012.
        That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An
        Awesome Wave.\n\nOn January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the
        band. \"Hunger of the Pine\" was released in June, with an accompanying video.
        Their second record, This is All Yours was released in September 2014.\n\nhttp://altjband.com   <a
